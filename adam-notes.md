## paper review

integration + ODEs (1st & 2nd order)

- operator = function
- operand = input

associative property states that you can add or multiply regardless of how the numbers are grouped

tree -> tree mappings
- require tree -> sequences (prefix notation)

prefix = polish = operator first

infix = normal = operator in the middle

Unary and binary operators. Operators that operate on two operands are known as binary operators. Operators that operate on one operand are known as unary operators.
